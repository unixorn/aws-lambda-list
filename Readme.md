A list of AWS lambdas and lambda-related resources. Hopefully some are even useful.

Please note that there are no guarantees that the functions here are safe to run - you're going to have to test them yourself.

This list is under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/unixorn/aws-lambda-list/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Frameworks

### [Apex](http://apex.run/)

Apex lets you use languages that are not natively supported by AWS Lambda, such as Golang, through the use of a Node.js shim injected into the build. A variety of workflow related tooling is provided for testing functions, rolling back deploys, viewing metrics, tailing logs, hooking into the build system and more.

### [Architect](https://arc.codes)

Architect defines infrastructure in a simple plaintext manifest `.arc` and utilizes npm script based workflows for provisioning cloud infrastructure in minutes and deploying in seconds.

Infra primitives supported:

- API Gateway Lambda functions; HTTP route handler functions for application/json and text/html
- SNS Lambda functions (and publish events from any other function)
- CloudWatch Events scheduled Lambda functions
- DynamoDB Database tables, indexes, and trigger Lambda functions

Architect governance is under the JS Foundation umbrella and is Apache 2.0 licensed.
